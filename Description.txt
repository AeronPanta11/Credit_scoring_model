A credit scoring model is a statistical tool used by lenders to evaluate the creditworthiness of potential borrowers. It analyzes various financial behaviors and credit history factors, such as payment history, outstanding debt, length of credit history, types of credit used, and recent credit inquiries. The model generates a numerical score, typically ranging from 300 to 850, which helps lenders assess the risk of default. A higher score indicates a lower risk, making it easier for individuals to secure loans and favorable interest rates. Credit scoring models play a crucial role in the lending process, promoting responsible borrowing and lending practices.
